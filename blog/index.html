              How I write acceptance specs
            </a>
          </h2>
          <p><em>This article is a work in progress. I&#39;m putting it out in public to motivate myself to complete it :)</em></p>
          
          <p><a href="https://github.com/gsmendoza/napybara">Napybara</a> is a ruby gem I wrote for building Capybara helpers. In this article, I&#39;ll describe how I use it and <a href="https://github.com/railsware/rspec-example_steps">rspec-example_steps</a> to write acceptance tests for Rails apps.</p>
          
          <h3>Use rspec-example_steps to describe the spec from the user&#39;s perspective</h3>
          
          <p><a href="https://github.com/railsware/rspec-example_steps">rspec-example_steps</a> is a gem for writing specs in Gherkin (aka Given-When-Then) format. It&#39;s an underrated alternative to Cucumber.</p>
          
          <p>Let&#39;s say we&#39;re building a to-do app. Our first feature is &quot;Users should be able to add a new to-do item.&quot; With rspec-example_steps and <a href="https://github.com/cavalle/steak">steak</a>, I can write that spec as</p>
          
          <pre><code>feature &quot;To-do: &quot; do&#x000A;  Steps &quot;Users should be able to add a new to-do item.&quot; do&#x000A;    Given &quot;I am in the home page&quot;&#x000A;    When &quot;I click the New To-Do link&quot;&#x000A;    Then &quot;I should see the New To-Do page&quot;&#x000A;    And &quot;I should see a form for adding a new to-do item&quot;&#x000A;    When &quot;I enter my to-do in the form&quot;&#x000A;    And &quot;I submit the form&quot;&#x000A;    Then &quot;I should see the To-Do List page&quot;&#x000A;    And &quot;I should see the to-do item that I entered there&quot;&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p><code>Steps</code> is basically a synonym of RSpec&#39;s <code>it</code>. Thus the whole &quot;Users should be able to add a new to-do item.&quot; block is basically an <code>it</code> block.</p>
          
          <p>If you&#39;re a Cucumber user, you&#39;ll notice that I&#39;m not worrying too much about the specificity and reusability of the steps. Cucumber users tend to debate a lot about how specific steps should be. In my opinion, steps are not the best place for building acceptance spec helpers. This is because steps are too coupled to their own descriptions. Natural-reading step descriptions rely heavily on the context of the spec they are used in, making them difficult to make context-insensitive. For example, in the &quot;I should see the to-do item that I entered there&quot; line, &quot;to-do item&quot; refers to some to-do item I entered in a previous step, and &quot;there&quot; refers to the To-Do List page. Had I chose to make the step context-insensitive, I could have written the last two lines this way:</p>
          
          <pre><code>Then &quot;I should see the To-Do List page&quot;&#x000A;And &quot;I should see the to-do item that I entered in the To-Do List page&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>Context-insensitive steps become redundant quickly. If your goal for writing specs in Gherkin is to communicate specs with non-technical people, presenting specs full of redundant step descriptions defeats that goal.</p>
          
          <p>What about the specificity of the steps? Shouldn&#39;t the steps be as general as possible, avoiding mentions to UI details like links and forms? My take here is that it&#39;s difficult for a single developer much less a team of developers to determine the single, right layer for describing domain concepts. Rather than taking that path, I recommend making steps as fine as possible, depending on how complex the feature is. Complex features require fine and numerous steps, while simple features can utilize more general ones. With finer steps, you can implement complex features easier, since you have less to do to implement each step.</p>
          
          <p>The specificity of steps also depend on how integral the steps are to the spec you&#39;re implementing. If you&#39;re implementing a spec for editing an existing to-do item, you don&#39;t have to make the steps for creating that existing to-do item to be as fine as the steps for the &quot;Users should be able to add a new to-do item.&quot; Since the existence of the to-do item is just an assumption in the spec, you can simply summarize that assumption in one step:</p>
          
          <pre><code>Given &quot;I have an existing to-do item&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>So to recap, our goal with each spec is to make the steps as natural-sounding as possible. We&#39;re not concerning ourselves with figuring out a &quot;right&quot; level of specificity for the steps in order to make them reusable. How then do we make reusable helpers for our acceptance tests?. This is where Napybara comes in.</p>
          
          <h3>Describe each step</h3>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Describe how to interact with the page and its elements in an objecti-oriented, not procedural-oriented, fashion.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Pattern: Napybara elements with values</h3>
          
          <ul>
          <li>If a Napybara element represents some object in the domain, add a <code>value</code> method to it. Let the method return the value represented by the element.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Implement the feature step by step</h3>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Build the Napybara page along with the actual UI.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Move Napybara page to its own module for reuse in other specs</h3>

              PageObject + SimpleDelegator = Awesome Capybara Helpers
            </a>
          </h2>
          <p>I&#39;ve always liked using the <a href="http://blog.josephwilk.net/cucumber/page-object-pattern.html">Page Object pattern</a> to write  concise, namespaced, and composeable capybara helpers:</p>
          
          <pre><code>When /^I register as a new user$/ do&#x000A;  NewUserPage.new(self).tap do |page|&#x000A;    page.visit!&#x000A;    page.form.fill&#x000A;    page.form.submit!&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;class PageObject&#x000A;  attr_reader :page&#x000A;&#x000A;  def initialize(page)&#x000A;    @page = page&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;class NewUserPage &lt; PageObject&#x000A;  def visit!&#x000A;    page.visit new_user_path&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  def form&#x000A;    @form ||= UserForm.new(self)&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;class UserForm &lt; PageObject&#x000A;  attr_reader :parent&#x000A;&#x000A;  def initialize(parent)&#x000A;    @parent = parent&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  def fill&#x000A;    page.find(&#39;[name$=&quot;[name]&quot;]&#39;).set &#39;George&#39;&#x000A;    page.find(&#39;[password$=&quot;[password]&quot;]&#39;).set &#39;password&#39;&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  def page&#x000A;    parent.page&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  def submit!&#x000A;    page.find(&#39;input[type=submit]&#39;).click&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>However, with this PORO implementation, constantly calling <code>page</code> in the PageObject classes can be annoying. It would be nice to call the Capybara helpers directly without having to mix in Capybara::DSL and all those rspec/capybara helpers into PageObject.</p>
          
          <p>Turns out there is. And it&#39;s in the standard Ruby library.</p>
          
          <p><a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/delegate/rdoc/SimpleDelegator.html">SimpleDelegator</a> &quot;provides the means to delegate all supported method calls to the object passed into the constructor&quot;. So if I subclass the NewUserPage class from SimpleDelegator:</p>
          
          <pre><code>class NewUserPage &lt; SimpleDelegator&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>And I instantiate it with the the test suite itself:</p>
          
          <pre><code>When /^I register as a new user$/ do&#x000A;  new_page = NewUserPage.new(self)&#x000A;  # ...&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>Then Capybara helpers like <code>visit</code> or <code>find</code> automatically become available to <code>new_page</code>! So now I can write the PageObject classes like this:</p>
          
          <pre><code>class NewUserPage &lt; SimpleDelegator&#x000A;  def visit!&#x000A;    visit new_user_path&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  def form&#x000A;    @form ||= UserForm.new(self)&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;class UserForm &lt; SimpleDelegator&#x000A;  def fill&#x000A;    find(&#39;[name$=&quot;[name]&quot;]&#39;).set &#39;George&#39;&#x000A;    find(&#39;[password$=&quot;[password]&quot;]&#39;).set &#39;password&#39;&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  def submit!&#x000A;    find(&#39;input[type=submit]&#39;).click&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>

              A workaround for isolated tests with local steps in Cucumber
            </a>
          </h2>
          <hr>
          
          <p>I&#39;ve always wanted to write tests using <a href="https://github.com/codegram/spinach">Spinach</a>. Unlike Cucumber, steps in Spinach are local to the feature they are defined. Therefore, they do not conflict with step definitions in other features.</p>
          
          <p>However, we&#39;re using Cucumber in our project. The Cucumber way doesn&#39;t allow steps local to a scenario. In fact, it even considers it an <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Feature-Coupled-Steps-(Antipattern">anti-pattern</a>).</p>
          
          <p>Last week though, I had an idea: why not stamp each step with a scenario ID so that the step is local to the scenario? Using the spinach example, I ended with something like this:</p>
          
          <pre><code># features/1_greetings.feature&#x000A;&#x000A;Scenario: Formal greeting&#x000A;  Given I have an empty array [#1]&#x000A;  And I append my first name and my last name to it [#1]&#x000A;  When I pass it to my super-duper method [#1]&#x000A;  Then the output should contain a formal greeting [#1]&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>The #1 stamp id can be any value. However, I like to use ticket numbers for documentation.</p>
          
          <p>I then placed all the steps in one step definition file:</p>
          
          <pre><code># features/step_definitions/1_greetings.rb&#x000A;&#x000A;Given &#39;I have an empty array [#1]&#39; do&#x000A;  #...&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;And &#39;I append my first name and my last name to it [#1]&#39; do&#x000A;  #...&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;When &#39;I pass it to my super-duper method [#1]&#39; do&#x000A;  #...&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;Then &#39;the output should contain a formal greeting [#1]&#39; do&#x000A;  #...&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>Benefits:</p>
          
          <ol>
          <li>I can read the implementation of the scenario in one file. I can also write the step definitions from top to bottom, making them easier to read.</li>
          <li>The descriptions of the step definitions are within the context of the scenario. This allows me to write step definitions that are more concise, since I can choose not to add details that are already implied elsewhere in the scenario. This makes the scenario more natural to read.</li>
          <li>If I change a step definition, I don&#39;t have to worry about the change breaking other tests.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>Of course, the step definitions are not reusable, but for me, that&#39;s a plus. The use of regular expressions as step definition arguments makes it difficult to find the implementation of a step. It&#39;s also not easy to remove or change a step definition since you can&#39;t immediately tell if the step is used in other features.</p>
          
          <p>I presented this approach to the Cucumber guy in the team. He&#39;s not too hot about it :) While he agrees that reusing steps creates more problems that it solves, he believes that if you can make a step explicit enough, it would prevent steps from colliding. Besides, he says that you <em>do</em> want explicit steps because they become your tools for communicating the language of the project&#39;s domain. In other words, a step should be a concrete atomic construct of the domain language.</p>
          
          <p>This notion of making steps atoms of the domain language is certainly possible (just look at the apps in RelishApps). However, I think this idea was also primarily made out of the desire to make the steps reusable. If you agree that reusable steps are more painful than beneficial, and that long, explicit step definition are unnatural to read, is there any other reason to make each step unique and explicit?</p>
          
          <p>With the ticket number approach above, I&#39;ve decided to express domain concepts one level higher: from the step to the scenario. Unlike the step, the scenario is sure to be isolated: it is a self contained story within the domain. The steps can now be local to the scenario: their implementation will just depend on the context of the scenario. The scenarios are now the tools for communicating the domain language, not the steps.</p>
          
          <p>Your thoughts?</p>
